## About DropzoneJS

This is the Drupal 8 integration for [DropzoneJS](http://www.dropzonejs.com/).

###How to install:
1. Download this module
2. [Download DropzoneJS](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone) and place it in the libraries folder
3. Install dropzonejs the [usual way](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8)

You will now have a dropzonejs element at your disposal.

###Future plans:
- A dropzonejs field widget.
- Handling already uploaded files.
- Removing files that failed dropzonejs validation from temp storage.
- Removing files that were removed by the user on first upload from temp storage.

###Project page:
Currently still without a drupal.org repository (https://
www.drupal.org/project/dropzonejs seems like a project without maintainer).

+ Janez Urevc (@slashrsm) drupal.org/u/slashrsm
+ John McCormick (@neardark) drupal.org/u/neardark
+ Primoz Hmeljak (@primsi) drupal.org/u/Primsi
